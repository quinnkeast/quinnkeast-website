            I enjoy crafting new user experiences and working to make existing
            ones perform better. The processes and thinking involved in creating
            digital products through human-centred design are immensely
            satisfying.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have more than a decade of expertise that covers the entire
            human-centred design process: from research and strategy to finished
            interface design and front-end development. My background is in
            design, which is complemented by a lifetime of tinkering with
            digital tools, languages, and technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2011, I co-founded{" "}
            <a href="https://caribou.co" target="_blank">
              Caribou
            </a>
            , a user experience strategy and design consultancy that works with
            product teams and organizations to make better products and
            experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aside from all that, I’m a Canadian currently working out of Berlin,
            and I enjoy playing Ultimate frisbee, bouldering, writing, and
            baking macarons.
          </p>

          <p>
            Want to know about my guiding values and how I work as a human? I’ve
            created a{" "}
            <Link href="/readme">
              <a>Quinn.ReadMe</a>
            </Link>{" "}
            that acts as a user guide for me.
