I want your words, your ideas, your patterns of thought and expression.

I don’t want the LLM’s interpretation of your prompt.

Your writing is an expression of you. Your use of a LLM is a mask; your use of a LLM to replace your expression of yourself is misleading at best, deceptive at worst.

Use it as a tool. Use it to explore your own words from different perspectives. Use it for feedback and to improve.

But don’t give away your own voice. You’re giving away your self.
