Generative AI is shifting its eye-of-Sauron-like gaze (and insane _how-is-this-not-a-bubble_ capitalization) towards design, and it repels me to my core.

Generative AI will be flaunted as the solution for “doing design,” “making mockups,” and “speeding up design iteration.”

The point of design (focusing here on user interface / user experience / HCI design) is not to generate mockups.

Design is a process of rigorous thinking, applied iteratively, with accumulated intent.

All the artifacts we create during design are a reflection of this intent.

Generative AI might bring raw speed and breadth to “design iteration” by generating mockups or UIs, and ‘designers’ might reflect on these and then write more prompts. I’m sure this will be called “vibe designing.” I think this, at best, leads to backwards-looking intent—post-facto rationalization—shifting ever towards subjective and reactionary decisions while further devaluing design as a craft.

I think craft is a measure of cumulative intent. Craft is a measure of respect for our users, for each other as colleagues, and for ourselves as designers.

Remove the craft and what the fuck are we even doing? Why should we undercut ourselves as both designers and users?
