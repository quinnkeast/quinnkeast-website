- Clicky-looking things get clicked; important things that aren’t clicky-looking get overlooked.
- Things that cover up the focal thing get dismissed. Things that try and draw attention away from the focal thing get ignored. With vigor.
- Safe-seeming things get tried. Other things get avoided. It’s rarely obvious what will seem safe.

- Every extra thing you add to teach someone how to do something is an extra thing they’ll ignore.
