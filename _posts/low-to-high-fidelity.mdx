The shift from low fidelity design exploration to high fidelity is some kind of hell. At low fidelity, everything’s magical. It’s so easy to follow. The content is clear. The flow is obvious. It’s all _blue_. Then you shift over and try and translate that to high fidelity and it’s like trying to make an oil painting with the eraser end of a grubby pencil. Even if it’s the most straightforward, logical, obvious interface where everything just works, theoretically, with all the patterns and tokens and components you already have.

I think it’s because low fidelity design is still a form of complete, cohesive design. When it’s translated to high fidelity, it’s not like swapping a theme or snapping a blueprint in place—it’s still a _translation_. And translation is a lossy, transformative process.
