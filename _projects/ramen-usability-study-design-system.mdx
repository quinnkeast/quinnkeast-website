**For Marley Spoon’s dedicated culinary teams in Germany, Australia, and the United States, designing, testing, and delivering more than 20 recipes for rolling weekly menus is a relentless culinary odyssey.** To get it done, the team relies on Ramen, Marley Spoon’s internal platform to support end-to-end recipe and menu management.

Marley Spoon is a multinational meal kit company that helps people save time while eating healthy, home-cooked meals. Each week, people choose meals they’d like to cook from a changing weekly menu and receive all of the ingredients and recipes they need directly to their door. Since launch, Marley Spoon has delivered 27 million meals to home cooks in three continents and eight countries around the world.

In 2019, faced with growing technical and design debt, I led a discovery initiative to uncover usability challenges and opportunities with Ramen, and launched two separate projects to take action on what we learned.

The Challenge
When Marley Spoon launched in 2014, the business model focused on customers purchasing individual boxes on a one-off basis. It wasn’t until later that they switched to a subscription model and expanded their weekly menus from from six to twenty unique recipes.

This transformation meant that the original internal software platform could no longer sustainably support the culinary and procurement workflows, and was a limiting factor in expanded product offerings.

In response, the company introduced Ramen, an internal platform, to support the culinary team’s recipe creation and catalogue management and to act as the backbone for critical long-term strategic initiatives.

Simply put, Ramen helps the culinary team manage everything related to ingredients, recipes, and weekly menus.

When I joined Marley Spoon, the Ramen project had already shipped an Minimum Viable Product that met the team’s short-term needs. However, the product had not received any previous product or UX design support.

As the Ramen team planned their roadmap for the coming year, they realized that the platform was already suffering from usability issues that would only compound if they didn’t address the accumulated design debt before moving ahead with their product roadmap.

As UX Lead at Marley Spoon, it was my responsibility to determine the best way to provide support for this mission-critical but internal-facing product.

## Research & Usability Testing

Activities needed to fit within the lean UX team’s existing capacity, while building a shared understanding of short- and long-term priorities among the cross-disciplinary product team.

To give the team a starting point for moving forward, I planned and conducted a series of usability testing sessions and ethnographic research with the culinary team.

I designed the research activities to reflect the tasks that culinary team members carry out during their day-to-day work. Members of the cross-functional team were invited to join and observe during each session. I also spent time working with the culinary team members during their daily activities to understand how their day unfolds and the environments that they work within. I wanted to better understand and where things were going well and where they faced challenges.

## Research Outcomes

Based on the outcomes of the sessions, I identified a series of “usability hotspots” for the team to address. I worked together with the product manager and development lead to prioritize and plan the right approach to addressing the challenges sustainably.

I proposed two separate projects to move us forward. The first project would address **immediate, high-priority usability issues** that either had or might contribute to negative business impact (for example, one specific usability issue directly resulted in occasionally shipping the wrong ingredient for a recipe to customers). These challenges would be tackled on a case-by-case basis.

The second project would address the remaining issues that had **common themes in UI design**: inconsistency in design elements, colours, information architecture, and language, as well as poor accessibility and HCI patterns. In response to these issues, we decided to create a formal design system for Ramen.

By creating a well-crafted design system for Ramen, I was able to address the majority of mid- and low-level usability issues in a way that would empower the product team to work more quickly in the future with minimal design resources, while leaving existing workflows and activities as-is. The design system was created and documented in Figma using atomic design principles, shared with the product team, which implemented the design system on a rolling basis as part of everyday work.

## The Result

The project solved major usability issues almost immediately (that one issue related to shipping the wrong ingredient to customers—gone!). And the Ramen design system brought consistency and predictability to every aspect of the platform while helping the product team create and implement new features with sustainable time commitment from Marley Spoon’s lean UX team.

The most delightful outcome: both the culinary and product team expressed feeling heard, involved, and empowered by the process of usability testing, through the immediate action to address high-priority usability issues, and through the long-term support solidified in the evolving design system.
