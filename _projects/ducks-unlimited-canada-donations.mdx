**[Ducks Unlimited Canada](https://ducks.ca/) (DUC), a nonprofit environmental conservation organization, conserves wetlands and other natural spaces for waterfowl, wildlife, and people.** For more than eighty years, the organization has been protecting and managing habitats across Canada that affect the lives of millions of Canadians every day.

As part of the organization’s [ongoing renewal of its digital ecosystem](https://quinnkeast.com/projects/ducks-unlimited-canada-supporter-engagement-strategy/), I initiated a project to revitalize the user experience of making online donations to Ducks Unlimited Canada. Our goal: increase supporter engagement and donor activity while streamlining the donation process with a new, sustainable digital platform.

This project supported DUC's recently completed Rescue Our Wetlands fundraising campaign, which conserved more than 650,000 acres of wetlands and native habitats across Canada while influencing another 96 million acres of habitats from coast to coast.

As the UX lead on this project, I lead the organization through a human-centred process of research and discovery, strategy, business alignment, user interface and interaction design, usability testing, and development. The result: a usable, effective, and sustainable donation experience for Ducks Unlimited Canada.
