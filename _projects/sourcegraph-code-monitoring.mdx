- One of the first things I worked on at Sourcegraph
- "Saved searches / saved search notifications"
- Open-ended problem space: known to be used and useful, but consistent feedback that it's hard to use and confusing
- As designer, asked to explore the problem space and propose what to do
- Research to understand the features, how they're used, how they came about
- Ultimately proposed that there are two separate features here that got tangled together, and that it made sense to untangle them
- Working with engineers, ultimately proposed code monitoring: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_R5DgpUkxyZilsJ9vBQm5cvRPT2udc3tZIPg2q3cnZU/edit#
