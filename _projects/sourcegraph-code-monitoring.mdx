- One of the first things I worked on at Sourcegraph
- "Saved searches / saved search notifications"
- Open-ended problem space: known to be used and useful, but consistent feedback that it's hard to use and confusing
- As designer, asked to explore the problem space and propose what to do

## Discovery

- Research to understand the features, how they're used, how they came about
- Review user feedback
- Interviews with customers that used the saved search notifications
- Together with engineers, a picture became clear: these two features are two separate things that got tangled together

## Strategy

- From the research, identified clear problems
- Captured these in a design challenge and collaborated with engineers on the team to propose a new feature: Code monitoring. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_R5DgpUkxyZilsJ9vBQm5cvRPT2udc3tZIPg2q3cnZU/edit#

## Design

- Based on the design challenge, did low-fidelity exploration of how we might approach designing this feature
- Low fidelity to focus on problems being solved and the interaction model and workflow
- Collaboration with engineering and PM during
- Converged on a promising approach
- Identified a good iterative approach that would get us to a shipped, testable feature as quickly as possible
- Landed on clear definition of first iteration
- Core UI, single trigger, single action with limited recipients
- In low fidelity, explored possible future state to make sure approach was systematically sustainable and presented a vision of the future
- Conducted user testing with customers using low-fidelity prototypes, iterated based on this
- High fidelity of first iteration
- Design artifact as source of truth

## Delivery

- First iteration built and shipped
- HEART framework used to track adoption and engagement
- Based on feedback from customers, confident in approach

## Results

- Heavily used by many of our largest customers
- A key part of early sales conversations and frequently mentioned as a contributor in landing new customers
- Design approach formed basis of year-long feature roadmap, building on top of the MLP, unlocking additional value for new customers
