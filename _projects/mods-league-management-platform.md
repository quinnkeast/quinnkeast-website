**The Manitoba Organization of Disc Sports (MODS) supports the sport of Ultimate Frisbee by providing opportunities to learn, play, and teach the sport.** Founded in 1988, the non-profit organization experienced explosive growth over the last several years and currently supports more than 4,600 athletes in programs every week of the year.

When MODS was considering creating a new Ultimate league management platform, I was asked to shine a light on what would deliver the best experience for their players, captains, and staff.

In just four weeks, I helped conduct a user experience research and strategy project, and used our findings to define the requirements for an effective, usable Ultimate league management platform.
