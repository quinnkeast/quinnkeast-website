**[Marley Spoon](https://marleyspoon.de) helps people around the world to save time while cooking healthy, home-cooked meals.** Each week, Marley Spoons helps customers in three continents and eight countries to choose meals they’d like to cook from a changing weekly menu and receive all of the ingredients and recipes they need directly to their door.

Since launching in 2015, Marley Spoon has delivered more than 27 million meals to its global audience. Over the past five years, Marley Spoon’s digital experience has evolved alongside its core product offering. But in 2019, it was time to reimagine the company’s mobile experience to better deliver an end-to-end product experience that united the digital and physical halves of the meal kit experience.

As UX Lead, I defined and carried out a complete reimagination of the Marley Spoon mobile experience: the affectionately named Project Dollop. Over the course of six months, I lead a seven-person project team through research and discovery, strategy, and iterative design. The result: a new white-label mobile experience foundation that serves three different brands across a global market.

## The Challenge

<p class="py-2 px-4 bg-yellow-100 rounded-md text-sm leading-tight">**Please note**: Due to active non-disclosure agreements, I cannot share design process and outcomes. This case study tells the story of the project and gives a peek “behind the scenes.”</p>

When Marley Spoon started, the business model focused on customers purchasing individual boxes on a one-off basis. It wasn’t until later in their growth that they switched to a subscription model, and expanded from six to twenty unique recipes in each weekly menu.

Marley Spoon’s mobile app was created when the web platform was the company’s primary digital product. It was designed to support one-off box purchases, and wasn’t intended to deliver an experience beyond facilitating these purchases.

Additionally, in 2017, the company launched a sister brand, Dinnerly, which was delivered using the same underlying platforms, simply copy-pasted for the new brand.

This led to Marley Spoon’s mobile platforms being full of accumulated design and tech debt, making them hard to work with, hard to keep in sync, and hard to evolve to support new product opportunities.

In 2019, the company recognized that it was moving into a truly mobile-first era with its customers. In response, I was asked to put together a project plan and lead the way in reimagining the Marley Spoon mobile app to better bridge user and business needs today and in the future.

## Project planning

I planned a project strategy based around the human-centred design process, with distinct phases of:

<p class="text-center">Discovery → Strategy → Design → Delivery</p>

With defined scopes, this would give us a clear timespan to guide feasibility and viability from the beginning. My goal was to make it easier to make decisions as a team, avoid scope creep, and drive creativity through clear constraints. Together, we would work to deliver the Minimum Lovable Product.

## Discovery

To kick off the project and align the cross-disciplinary team from the beginning, I designed and held two workshops: a product vision workshop, and a principles workshop.

The outcomes of these workshops gave us a shared context to connect us as a team as we moved forward.

<p class="py-2 border-y border-y-black-lighter">**Read more:** [Stop relying on gut decisions and define your principles](/writing/stop-relying-on-gut-decisions-and-define-your-principles)</p>

I led the team in planning a research and discovery phase to help us better understand the experience as it exists today, and where we’d find the biggest opportunities to transform the experience. As a digital product that enables a physical product experience, we had the unique challenge of directly affecting our customer’s kitchen and cooking experience.

To bring greater transparency and openness around the project to the whole company, we set up a “war room” for our research activities. Anyone walking by could stop and see what we were doing and directly contribute to our work.

We conducted journey mapping workshops with several cross-disciplinary teams to get a better sense of the complete customer journey. We used the journey map to identify potential key moments to research further.

We did a competitive analysis as a team, signing up for competing services, ordering mealkits, and cooking meals as a group. To build stronger cross-country collaboration in the early stages of the project, we asked the marketing and culinary teams in the USA and Australia to do the same.

A deep dive into customer support contacts and workshops with the customer care team revealed several common themes around the current experience.

	</div>
</div>

We also needed a much deeper understanding of our customer’s kitchen environment and routines. How does the process of planning, receiving, and cooking our meals unfold? Who’s involved? What kind of physical environment are they working within?

To build this understanding, I planned and conducted a diary study with the team. We asked more than 30 customers in the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia to document their experience receiving and cooking their mealkits using photos, videos, and notes. After our participants shared their outcomes, we held followup interviews to dig deeper into their stories.

I guided synthesis sessions after each research activity, and we created a master insights document. This was a living document that we added to and changed over time to reflect what we learned.

## Strategy

At the end of our discovery phase, we had an extensive insights document with clear themes and challenges.

Instead of approaching the project as one large, potentially overwhelming task, I worked with the project team to identify the key areas of the user journey and create design challenges for each area. Then, we could structure our work into a series of 2-4 week cycles of design exploration, prototyping, testing, and iteration focused on each key area.

We identified four key areas of the mobile experience: planning, receiving, cooking, and management.

Each area had its own set of “**How Might We’s**” based on the discovery phase outcomes. Some examples of the challenges include:

<figure class="my-4">
	<img src="/assets/projects/dollop-hmws.png" class="mx-auto" />
</figure>

One of the key challenges I identified while defining the product strategy was in our white label approach. Marley Spoon has three separate brands: Marley Spoon, its namesake; Martha & Marley Spoon, its American identity; and Dinnerly, its budget-friendly sister brand in the USA and Australia.

We knew that our work needed to support all three of these brands effortlessly. That posed a compelling challenge in design. In response, I proposed that we introduce a “white label” approach from the very start. Instead of designing “the Marley Spoon app,” we would design the “Dollop app,” a brand-independent foundation that delivers the best possible user experience. Then, the unique brand identities and personalities would build on top of a solid, validated foundation.

This approach ultimately fed into the creation of the Pistachio Design System, a white-label, extensible, atomic design system for all of Marley Spoon’s mobile apps.

## Design

<p class="py-2 px-4 bg-yellow-100 rounded-md text-sm leading-tight">**Please note**: Due to non-disclosure agreements, I cannot share design process and outcomes. This case study tells the story of the project and gives a peek “behind the scenes.”</p>

At the beginning of each cycle, we re-aligned on our focus and design challenges. Then, we moved through rapid cycles of ideation and prototyping. I planned and scheduled remote user testing sessions each Friday, which let us test and iterate on our ideas quickly.

Within each cycle, we converged on the most promising directions and underlying interaction patterns. Throughout this early stage, we kept to low- and medium-fidelity design outcomes.

### Improving prototyping

We built our first few prototypes using Figma. However, we quickly discovered that one particular workflow (choosing and swapping recipes for a box from a weekly menu of recipes) was challenging to test without an incredibly complex and fragile prototype.

In response, another designer on the project team proposed we explore using Protopie for the prototype. This change in tooling was transformational for the design team because it let us explore several ideas in much more “real world” fidelity, and ultimately enabled us to test our ideas in kitchen environments.

Throughout the project, we did design exploration and rapid prototyping in Figma. Then, we would bring our concepts into a single, versioned Protopie prototype for testing with users. This resulted in a prototype that delivered most of the functionality of the complete app, with realistic UI animations, transitions, and statefulness. This prototype serves as a living reference for the development team in delivery.

## Delivery

As we approached the end of the initial design phase, we took stock of how we would shift into supporting the delivery phase.

We wanted to avoid a waterfall-style handoff from design to development, and to enable ongoing design iteration on a few key areas that we flagged for further exploration while development got underway.

### Pistachio Design System
We decided to formalize what we call the Pistachio Design System: an atomic, themeable white-label design system that serves as the foundation for all of Marley Spoon’s apps.

This had the added benefit of letting us work in parallel with an ongoing brand refresh project for the Marley Spoon brand: even though we didn’t have clarity around the final brand identity elements, it wouldn’t serve as a blocker for development.

### Minimum Lovable Product Design Specs
As we converged on the Minimum Lovable Product in design, I conducted a user story mapping workshop based on our prototyping to visualize and plan development execution, as well as to adjust scope where required due to evolving capacity and business priorities.

Then, the design team created a design spec file that captured all screens and states, along with detailed documentation around behaviour and functionality. This gave the entire project team a source of truth to reference alongside our Protopie prototype during development.

## The Result

The Dollop app is in active development with an expected launch in Summer 2020, and will deliver a delightful, intuitive experience to tens of thousands of home cooks around the world across three different brands. It’s a key part of Marley Spoon’s long-term strategy and will support more than €130m in annual revenue.

The Pistachio design system is under ongoing formalization and development, supported by concrete product principles, an extensive product content and language framework, and easy-to-use internal tooling.
