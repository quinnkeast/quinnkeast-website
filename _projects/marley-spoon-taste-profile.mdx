**Planning healthy, fresh, and easy meals should be a delight, not a chore.** That’s why [Marley Spoon](https://marleyspoon.de) gives people the choice of more than 20 recipes from a changing weekly menu, and delivers all of the ingredients and recipes they need directly to their door.

Marley Spoon is a multinational meal kit company that has delivered more than 27 million meals to customers in three continents and eight countries around the world over the past five years.

When the company wanted to leverage machine learning to expand beyond its existing 20-recipe menu with the help of personalized taste preferences, I lead research, UX strategy, and design for Marley Spoon’s “Taste Profile” project—the first step in unlocking the perfect menu.
