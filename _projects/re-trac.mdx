**Waste and recycling data management isn’t glamorous.** But for Re‑TRAC Connect’s passionate product team, making it easier for communities and organizations to track and share their waste management data is at the heart of their vision for a sustainable future.

Re-TRAC Connect's product team wanted to create a better experience for the people using Re‑TRAC Connect to report their waste and recycling data. The team understood that this was essential to serve their current North American client base as well as expand successfully to new geographic markets. They were primed and ready to go, but they needed a partner to guide them forward through user experience research and put findings into action through a pair of design sprints.

Together with my partner, I carried out qualitative and quantitive research, several hands-on workshops, two design sprints, and a lot of user testing.
