**[Ducks Unlimited Canada](https://ducks.ca) (DUC), a nonprofit environmental conservation organization, conserves wetlands and other natural spaces for waterfowl, wildlife, and people.** For more than eighty years, the organization has been protecting and managing habitats across Canada that affect the lives of millions of Canadians every day.

DUC was an early adopter of the web as a platform for communications and fundraising, launching its first website as early as 1996 (view on Wayback Machine). However, by late 2015, its online experience was becoming fractured and disconnected. DUC needed a new vision to unite and direct its digital platforms.

In response, I initiated and lead a project to define and implement a new supporter engagement strategy to create a compelling vision for DUC’s digital ecosystem and build a better user experience.
