**For students with hearing loss or other physical or mental disabilities, notetaking services are a critical service for making the classroom accessible.**

Right now, notetakers deliver transcriptions through an improvised collection of software intended for other purposes, such as text editors, word processors, and chat applications.

Walnut is a project under active development that provides real-time transcriptions to students through a web and mobile app that allows transcribers and students to send and receive—essentially—real-world captions for lectures and in-class discussions.
