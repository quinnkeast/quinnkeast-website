**[Ducks Unlimited Canada](https://ducks.ca) (DUC), a nonprofit environmental conservation organization, conserves wetlands and other natural spaces for waterfowl, wildlife, and people.** For more than eighty years, the organization has been protecting and managing habitats across Canada that affect the lives of millions of Canadians every day.

In late 2015, I lead a project to define and implement a new supporter engagement strategy for DUC’s digital ecosystem ([read the case study](https://quinnkeast.com/projects/ducks-unlimited-canada-supporter-engagement-strategy/)).

Based on this strategy, we needed to create a new UI design system that would unify DUC’s digital platforms through a common design language. This new design system would be put into action as we renewed DUC’s public outreach website based on user and business insights.
